      <h4 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Russia is a country located in northern Eurasia. It is the largest country in the world by land area, covering over 17 million square kilometers. It has a population of approximately 144 million people and its capital and largest city is Moscow.

        Russia has a rich history that spans over a thousand years. It was originally inhabited by Slavic and Finno-Ugric peoples, and its earliest state was Kievan Rus in the 9th century. During the Middle Ages, Russia was ruled by various dynasties, including the Mongols, who established the Golden Horde in the 13th century. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the Romanov dynasty came to power and ruled Russia for over 300 years.
        
        In 1917, the Russian Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the Romanovs and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Under Soviet rule, Russia became one of the two superpowers of the world, along with the United States, during the Cold War. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia transitioned to a market-oriented economy and became the Russian Federation, a federal semi-presidential republic.
        
        Today, Russia is a major player on the global stage and is known for its vast natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, as well as its military and political power. The country has a mixed economy and continues to face challenges, including corruption, a declining population, and economic sanctions imposed by other countries.</h4>
