      <h4>Spain is a country located in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. It is the fourth largest country in Europe by land area, and has a population of approximately 47 million people. The capital and largest city of Spain is Madrid, and the country is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant cities, and beautiful landscapes.

        Spain has a long and storied history that dates back to prehistoric times. During the ancient period, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by various indigenous peoples, including the Celts, Iberians, and Romans. In the 8th century, Spain was conquered by the Moors, who established the Islamic Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba. The reconquest of Spain by Christian kingdoms, known as the Reconquista, took place over several centuries, and in 1492, the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon united to form modern-day Spain.
        
        Spain was a major global power during the 16th and 17th centuries, with a vast empire that included territories in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. During this time, Spain became one of the world's leading economic powers and a center for culture and the arts. However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the country experienced a decline in power and influence, and was marked by political turmoil and economic hardship.
